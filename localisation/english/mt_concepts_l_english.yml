 ### CONCEPTS
 #
 # Above each concept definition are instructions on usage, including an icon where one exists.
 #   Note that between the icon and the term there's a non-breaking space. When you copy the usage example, it will keep the non-breaking space.
 #   This is important to not get a line break between the icon and the concept.
 # Use a concept link with icon the first time a new concept is mentioned, then use §H without an icon for repeated uses.
 # Use §H with an icon the first time a concept is used withing its own description.
 # Use §H without an icon if the concept is used more than once.

 
 # Shorthand with §I highlighting
 # Use §K for headers and §I for highlights in Concepts
